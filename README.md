I created a clone of the website Old Reddit using React JS and Material CSS from scratch. This is a project which further improves on my previous project demonstrating usage of Material CSS. The Clone was coded in Codesandbox and a live example of the project is seen at https://kfyyng.csb.app/
The Codesandbox link is as follows: https://codesandbox.io/p/sandbox/festive-cloud-kfyyng
